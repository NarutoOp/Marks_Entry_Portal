## How to install? (for devs)

#### This installation assumed you have python 3.X installed. [Get python here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/python-3.8.1-amd64.exe)
 - Download [Plei](https://github.com/sakshatshinde/Plei/releases/download/1.0/Plei.rar) and extract it to your desired location
 - Run the following command
 > pip install -r requirements.txt
 - It might error out on "steamfiles" install. To fix this change your pip version to 9.0.X and run the above command again
 > python -m pip install pip==9.0.3 
 - app.pyw will launch Plei
 - Rename app.pyw to app.py to see the console message for logging/testing

## How to use it?

- When asked, the user must point the appropriate path to your game libraries. As in when asked for Steam point it to your Steam library (steamapps folder)
- If you have all your libraries in their default position no need to set them up again. Eg: `C:\Program Files(x86)\Origin Games\`
-  The above mentioned process maybe fully automated in the future
- After the initial setup you will be greeted with the installed games, just click on one to play it. Its that simple!
